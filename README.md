# org-password-storage
This describes how I set up an encrypted org-mode buffer on my mac using OpenPGP for storing sensitive information. The inspiration for this is here:

## Prerequisites
- This works for MacOS Sierra. Not tested on later.


## Install OpenPGP
I used [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) for MacOS. The key thing is enabling services.
